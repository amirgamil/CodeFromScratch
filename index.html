I am 17 years old and I started this initative with the sole aim of free education of coding and 21st century skills. I believe that equipping people with the skills to code leads to revolutionary inventions, from diagnosing cancer with algroithmic processing, to even something as simple as a fun game. At the heart of every breakthrough, every invention, every contribution to mankind, is some code, and when we can teach these skills to everyone worldwide, not only will we have a generation of problem solvers, but also a generation who can contribute positively to their community and to the rest of the world. So just remember: Learn to code. Change the world."</span></p>
