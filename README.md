Hello World! 
This is the source code for my project CodeFromScratch. It's built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. 
You can also access it live at https://www.codefromscratch.org/
Although there may have been changes in syntax with new releases of Swift, the underlying concepts remain the same. 
I hope to update and add to it at some point in the future!
